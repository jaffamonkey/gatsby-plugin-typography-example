        You have so many different things placeholder text has to be able to do,

        different things placeholder text has to be able to do, and I don't
        believe Lorem Ipsum has the stamina. I write the best placeholder text,
        and I'm the biggest developer on the web by far... While that's mock-ups
        and this is politics, are they really so different? I have a 10 year old
        son. He has words. He is so good with these words it's unbelievable. An
        ‘extremely credible source’ has called my office and told me that Barack
        Obama’s placeholder text is a fraud.
